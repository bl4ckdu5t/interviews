## Question
Given a grid with 3 columns and `n` rows, provided you have 3 crayons (red, green, and blue),
write a function that returns the number of ways colors can be arranged in the grid such that
no one column or row has only the same color all through.

For `f(n) = 2`, the function should return 174
